# React-apps
The apps I created when learning React :

- **[Counter-app](#counterApp)**
- **[Vidly](#vidly)**

## <a name="counterApp">Counter-App</a>

The **Counter-App** is a list of counters which each counter controle its state.
This app introduces the use of the react basics:
- Components 
- State
- Props
- Event handling
- Functional components 
- Life cycle hooks
